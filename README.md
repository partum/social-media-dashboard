## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This is the first project I've made with a dark-mode toggle. It was much easier than I thought it would be and this will definitely will come in handy, since a dark mode toggle is standard on many sites.

I use CSS grid for the first time in a while. I think I will use it more in the future, since it made laying out this grid fast and easy.

### Continued development

I uses regular CSS for this project, and I am reminded why every one loves Sass. I think I will stick with Sass from now on.
